# ThreeQueensAvenue

## About

3 Queen's Avenue, Woodford Green, Essex, IG8 0JE is a house that belonged to the Wright family for approximately 63 years, finally being sold on 6th June 2024. Walter and Tessa Wright bought the house for approximately Â£4000 and raised 5 children in it - Steve, Juliet, Miranda, Jon and Dave.

The images in this project were taken in 2018 as Walter and Tessa's health declined. It was inevitable that they would die some time in the next few years, so Dave took these photos as a memory of what the house was like. When COVID came in 2020 this project was transformed into an interactive tour of the house where multiple people could log in to a single server and then virtually tour the house together, such that you could play games like virtual tag or virtual hide and seek in the virtual 3QA.

If you are now reading this README file from a green SanDisk USB then you have found the project from where Dave stashed it. Feel free to ignore this altogether or e-mail me at [davewright320@yahoo.co.uk](mailto:davewright320@yahoo.co.uk) to let me know you've found it.

The project can also be found on GitHub at [https://github.com/VisionSoftwareLtd/ThreeQueensAvenue](https://github.com/VisionSoftwareLtd/ThreeQueensAvenue).
